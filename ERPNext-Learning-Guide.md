# Learning ERPNext

## Module 1

### 1.1 Introduction
This document assumes you are curious to know what ERPNext is about and you are interested in learning how to use it.

### 1.2 Quick overview
ERPnext is a software that runs on a linux computer (on virtualbox in any OS) or a server. You access it with a web browser.
You enter information about many things related to your company or organization:

* Customers
* Suppliers
* Sales
* Accounting
* Inventory of Items (Stock)
* Projects
* Manufacturing
* Retail sales

It is also incorporating several domain specific functions for industries such as:

* Education
* Agriculture
* Healthcare
* Non-Profits


ERPNext already has basic documentation, videos and a support group with plenty of community members that can support you on your journey to learn how to use this software.


### 1.3 Structure
The following course or tutorial is divided into 5 modules, which will enable you to master ERPNext.

Module 1: Introduction to ERPNext
Module 2: Basic usage
Module 3: Intermediate usage
Module 4: Advanced usage
Module 5: Becoming an expert

This course is divided in 5 modules. Each module will take your learning from the general
to the more specific, in the same manner that we talk about a ship in general terms, each 
additional module will explore the topics with more specificity about the ship, such as 
propulsion systems, bilge systems, navigation, crew, etc. At the end we will reach detailed
explanations about individual ship components such as engines, pumps, compass, captain's duties, etc.
With this, you can revise the basics or go down to the details when necessary to master ERPNext.

I personally like a specific order to better refer to topics in a structured manner, so I have
numbered items by levels, separated by decimals. Each module is at a level 1. Level 2 is represented
by a level one number, separated by a decimal and another number, and then another number
that begins the ordinal count of the topic within the module.
You can refer to a specific topic by the number. This also will help when indexing.
Each sub-topic is separated by a decimal point from the number that represents the parent or principal topic.

### 1.4 Objetivos del Módulo 1
- How to access or install and configure ERPNext

You use any web browser to manage anything related to ERPNext system.

You can run it locally on a linux machine, or in a virtual server on any operating system.

Ideally you use a web server with a public IP address so you can access the service from any internet
connected device.

This module focuses on learning to set it up, configuring it and use this instance to 
satisfy the basic accounting and management needs of a business or non-profit.

### 1.5 Getting an instance of ERPNext

#### 1.5.1 Trial account on  erpnext.com
The quickest and easiest way to learn it, is to open a trial account on  [erpnext.com](https://www.erpnext.com)
#### 1.5.1 - Local installation in any operating system with VirtualBox
The next easiest way is to download a pre-installed virtual image to use with Oracle's VirtualBox.
Download VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
Since ERPNext is [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license),
 you can download a production image directly from this site and use for any purpose allowed in the license:
[https://erpnext.com/download](https://erpnext.com/download)
You run virtualBox, import the appliance and start the server. Make sure you configure the
virtual networking cards properly. I usually use a Bridged adapter to my existing WiFi
connection on a MAC so that the virtual machine gets an IP address from my router. This way, I can
access it using a local IP address on the web browser.
